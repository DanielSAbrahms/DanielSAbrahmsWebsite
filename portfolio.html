            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. At the risk of being a bit clich&eacute;,
            I decided to break my work into two halves based on the division of the brain.
            The left half discusses my work in engineering and UX design, while the right half
            covers the various creative activities I spend my free time doing. A few of my
            academic projects are demonstrated here, as well as my work experience and side
            projects.

                <h3>NaukNauk</h3>
                <p>
                    NaukNauk is a very exciting project for me. The concept of an
                    office hour scheduling app came while my friend and I were
                    complaining about the difficulty of navigating the Gonzaga website,
                    as well as the individual websites some professors have. Both CS students,
                    we decided to use this concept as our assigned Android development project,
                    however conceptual development began far before this assignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognizing our different talents, I began the task of building the
                    UX for NaukNauk. Writing interfaces from the ground up is important to me,
                    but it never comes easy. I started with integrating some of Google's Material
                    Design elements in my own personal design philosophy. This pointed me in the
                    direction I needed. We ended up implementing Google Firestore, instead of
                    SQLite database, as we planned to, allowing live updates to the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not having a lot of time for writing this app, a simple front-end experience
                    demonstrated itself to be the number one priority. With this in mind, I designed a
                    basic and intuitive interface that accomplished that task, entirely in XML, a language
                    I am not too familiar with. I am happy with
                    how it turned out, but as we continue adding features, keeping the interface simple
                    will prove itself challenging.

                <h3>Web Design</h3>
                <p>
                    My interest in web design began when I started a position for Gonzaga's
                    Marketing and Communication department. Gonzaga was launching a new website, one
                    that focused on accessibility and visual appeal, and they needed eight student
                    employees. My position involved migrating content from the old site and adapting
                    it to meeting these standards.

                <img class="img"  style="max-height:400px; float: right;" src="Sources/health-wellness-screenshot.jpg">

                <p>
                    This position involved using SiteCore, the CMS used for managing the new site, as
                    well as working directly in HTML. As my knowledge of these tools grew, my confidence
                    of making design decisions grew. Ideas of how content should be organized filled my head.
                    However, my position did not always allow for content to be changed like I wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the site launched in the Winter of 2017, I was chosen as one of the two student
                    employees to continue working post launch. This new position, where I currently work,
                    involves consulting with clients on improving the content organization.
                    My communication and design skills are used to work with faculty and staff at GU,
                    allowing me to implement my ideas for these pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have included some screenshots of pages I wrote. The content is given from clients, while the
                    styling in provided by the Marketing and Communication department. Working exclusively in HTML doesn't
                    allow from much design freedom, with the accessibility goals of the site in mind. However, working
                    with bootstrap can help create some interesting pages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My first experience working with writing GUI's was in a OOP class, where we had two
                    weeks to write a functional game we designed, similar to Yahtzee, in Java. We also had
                    to implement a GUI for the game, entirely in Swing. Which was a real challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the small time-frame for this project, I decided to explicitly define
                    the pixel coordinates for each component. I wanted the user to have an intuitive experience
                    working with the game, so I tried to organize the components like a real game of
                    Yahtzee would be laid out on a table.

                    In high school, my passion was in 3D rendering.
                    I spent hours in <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, an
                    open-source software that I'm still proficient in to this day. Around 2014,
                    I started leaning more towards software development as my main hobby, but I still
                    enjoy working in the software for simple rendering or modeling objects for 3D Printing.
                    It taught me elements of photography, material design, image manipulation, and other skills
                    I still use in my career to this day.

                <p>
                    In late 2016, I realized my passion for music, especially composition. This began when I started taking
                    classes in Guitar, Piano, and Music theory. While I have yet to finish a complete song,
                    my abilities to write music, utilize music-production software, and experiment on
                    synthesizers are getting better and better. I don't expect myself to pursue music as a career,
                    but I will never stop expanding my knowledge and skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have included a fragment of a solo-piano piece I composed. It is not finished,
                    but I think it has potential and I am looking forward to completing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also started DJ'ing parties. I had a lot of misconceptions about what that would entail
                    when I started, but the more I learn about music genres, and how to tell a story while performing,
                    the more I enjoy doing it. Music has such a powerful effect and I am excited to see where a life of
                    learning, playing, and writing music will take me, even just as a hobby.
