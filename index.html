                Hi, my name is Daniel Abrahms. I am currently a third year student at
                Gonzaga University pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science.
                I have dipped my toes in many aspects of CS and have found my passion for
                designing and building intuitive and powerful user experiences. Representing
                complex data in a simple way and providing an accessible and enjoyable experience
                navigating through that information is a wonderful blend of engineering and art.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have grown up a bit from the child who wanted to be a master LEGO builder,
                but I never lost the love of putting simple blocks together to create something greater
                than the sum of its parts. This mentality applies to engineering as well as
                the many art forms I practice. I am very excited to continue perfecting my
                design and software abilities in my pursuit to never stop learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please, take some time to check out <a href="portfolio.html">my portfolio</a>.
                I wanted a simple way to demonstrate my engineering and artistic capabilities,
                while walking you through my mindset behind them. If you would like to contact
                me or request a copy of my resume, please shoot me an email at
                <a href="mailto:contact@danielabrahms.com">contact@danielabrahms.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enjoy!
